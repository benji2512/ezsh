# How To Contribute

This shell can __ALWAYS__ be improved. If you see any inconsistencies in the code or bugs - help me fix them!

### Guidelines

1. Pull requests to add features that have no corresponding issues will be closed.

3. If you have a feature idea, raise an issue detailing it. This doesn't mean you have to implement it yourself, but as stated above, pull requests that have no corresponding issue will be closed. This means that if you do want to implement a feature, it needs to be discussed first.

4. When it comes to spelling mistakes and minor fixes feel free to make a pull request - no need to raise an issue.
